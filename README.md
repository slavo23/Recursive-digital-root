Here are two implementations (recursive and iterative) of popular algorithm called digital root.
The purpose of it is calculating the sum of all digits represented in the input integer.
The algorithm goes on until the number of digits is more than one. As a result, it always returns
a single digit integer, no matter how large the input value was.
