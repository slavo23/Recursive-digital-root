Here are recursive implementation of popular algorithm called digital root. For comparison i've also added the iterative version of it.
The purpose of it is calculating the sum of all digits represented in the input integer.
The algorithm goes on while the number of digits is more than one. As a result, it always returns
a single digit integer, no matter how large the input value was.
